This is the portion of the ECE1140 project that I personally worked on. In order to not claim any work not completed by myself as my own,
I have separated my module into this repository. 

This Module used an ArduinoMega2560. Any form of replication should select the Arduino Model as such in the Arduino IDE.

Node Red was used for creating a test UI. In order to view this code properly outside of its JSON packaging:
  1. Download Node Red
  2. Open a Command Prompt
  3. 'node-red' *enter*
  4. Go to http://localhost:1880/#flow/55e22fddf4f7f530
  5. Import the JSON files as a flow
  6. Hit Deploy
  7. Got to http://localhost:1880/ui/#!/0?socketid=izSMD0ufvBRhYcAXAAAB
